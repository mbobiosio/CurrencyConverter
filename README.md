### CurrencyConverter
This simple Currency Converter app is designed to illustrate working with complex json objects as well showing usage of Flow, Live Data, Coroutines, Hilt - (Clean Architecture)

I also decided to use Room Database to store all currencies locally. This eliminates the dependency on internet everytime to fetch list of currencies.

Data is provided by [Currency Conversion API](https://currency.getgeoapi.com)
